		 	<p>When I was at University 9 years ago there was a conference called mobile commerce world, you needed to have an established business to attend the conference. So I setup a fake business called VS services and managed to attend the conference. There I saw many talks but the one that stood out was right at the end of the day with only a few people listening. It was called Personal Portal on Mobile Device. There I learnt how menus in black and white mobile displays could change according to what the user frequently clicked on. Eureka! It was then I envisioned a world where people would have personal content on mobile phones. I used this idea to create my final year project called M-Music where users browse music content and get recommendations based on what they click .  Today that vision is a reality.  </p>

		 	<p>Restless and wanting to do something I decided to walk into every shop in the area asking if they wanted a website with social media. I managed to find this company after a few shops. A bakery cooking cakes for customer in the local area we decided to create a new website with a professional design and include social media via facebook. I am now working on a facebook app which the owner can use to connect with his customers. It will allow him to add customers to his page and when they order a cake for a birthday for example, he will be able to take a photo of it during the baking stage and when finished. He can then post onto Facebook. The customer and their friends will be able to comment on the picture which will feed back into the bakeries page. After a few months he will have a load of product images with comments from customers and potential customers.</p>
